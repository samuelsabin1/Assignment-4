                    <p>Wonderful is it this old lady she knows the inner works and is a master at taming and appeasing the beast known as hunger. Who else can compare to the thankgiving dinners, the fried chicken, the mac n cheese with
                    the perfectly crispen cheese thats stuck to the side of the pan. The rice and beans with legume where every spoonful contains the perfect ratio of rice, bean sauce, legume, and beef (or pork depending on what is avaible). This God given human was an absolute blessing to your youth. You knew when hunger strikes at grandma's house you will be fed and fed you will and 
                    hunger shall be no more.
